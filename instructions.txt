Use the following steps to authenticate and push an image to your repository.
 For additional registry authentication methods, including the Amazon ECR credential helper, see Registry Authentication
.

    Retrieve an authentication token and authenticate your Docker client to your registry.
    Use the AWS CLI:
	
	aws ecr get-login-password --region ca-central-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 265341983127.dkr.ecr.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com
	
Build your Docker image using the following command. For information on building a Docker file from scratch see the instructions here
. You can skip this step if your image is already built:
	
	docker build -t dummy_ecr_repo .


After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:

	docker tag dummy_ecr_repo:latest 265341983127.dkr.ecr.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/dummy_ecr_repo:latest


Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:

	docker push 265341983127.dkr.ecr.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/dummy_ecr_repo:latest
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	docker run -it --name wavehq wavehq_exer:1.0 bash
